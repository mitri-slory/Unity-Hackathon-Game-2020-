# Unity-Hackathon-Game-2020-
A Unity Hackathon Game I created with four other teammates for my Computational Media: Video Game Development course. I was the lead coder with another teammate and the producer of the team contributing to the code as well. The goal is to collect as much coins as possible with a jump arc being the only movement option while escaping a tower that will fill up with lava once 2 minutes pass in-game. My main contributions were the score system, the lose condition with the lava rising once time is up, and the win condition of the game with the player returning to the entrnace before the lava get them. Also, I helped our producer with the menu transitions from the start menu, lose screen, win screen, and the game itself.
